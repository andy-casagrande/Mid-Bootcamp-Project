In this project, we will show women representation in movies using the Bechdel test. Even the test is more to show active roles of women in fiction and not an overall representation, 
we can use it to show.
The objective is to show the differences between the 70's and the 00's and see if the situation get better, same or worse
It'll show the differences in budget and international grossing of this movies to show the situation on the movies that
pass or fail the test
